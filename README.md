Exploratory Data Analysis Course Project 1
===========================================

In this project the measurements of electric power consumption in one household 
with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of 2 days in February 2007 are analysed.

The first program plot1.R draws a histogram of Global Active Power. plot1.png is the file which shows the histogram.

The second program plot2.R draws the line plot of Global Active Powe over the time period of 2 days. 
plot2.png is the file which shows the plot.

The third program plot3.R draws the line plots of Sub metering of 3 different areas in the house. <br>
plot3.png is the file which shows the plot.
    Sub metering 1 plot corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave. It is black line.
    Sub metering 2 plot corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light. It is the red line
    Sub metering 3 plot corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner. It is the blue line.

The fourth program plot4.R draws 4 plots as a 2X2 matrix. The plot4.png is the resulting plot.
    Upper left plot  - Variation of global active power over time.
    Upper right plot - Variation of Voltage over time.
    Lower left plot - Variation of energy sub metering in 3 different areas of the house over time.
    Lower right plot - Variation of global reactive power over time.
